# countdown_timer
Self-learning Python project. This project is a countdown timer in the range of minutes to second with my favorite song alarm. It is also converted to exe file, so the user don't need to download python but still can run the program.
Note: Press any button to stop the alarm sound. Otherwise, it will not stop until reaching the end of the sound file.
